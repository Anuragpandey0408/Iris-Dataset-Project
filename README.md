# **Iris Flower Classification** üå∏

![Iris Flower Dataset](https://i.imgur.com/ODFAcAT.png)

### **Overview**
This project uses machine learning techniques to classify **Iris flowers** into one of the three species: **Iris Setosa**, **Iris Versicolor**, and **Iris Virginica**. The classification is based on four features of the flowers: 
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

Using these features, we build and compare several machine learning models to predict the species of the Iris flower. After evaluating multiple models, we finalize **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** due to its superior accuracy.

## **Problem Statement** üí°
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict the species of an Iris flower based on its physical features. This is a supervised classification problem where the task is to classify each flower into one of three species: **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, or **Virginica**.

---

## **Dataset Information** üìä
The dataset used in this project is the famous **Iris dataset**, available from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris). The dataset consists of **150 observations**, each with:
- 4 features: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width.
- 3 target classes: Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica.

---

## **Technologies Used** üíª
- **Python** üêç
- **Pandas** for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn** for building and evaluating machine learning models.
- **NumPy** for numerical computations.

## **Installation and Setup** ‚öôÔ∏è

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### **1. Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Iris-Flower-Classification.git
cd Iris-Flower-Classification



---

## **Conclusion** ‚úÖ
The SVM model was the most accurate with a **96.6% accuracy** on the validation set. This project demonstrates how to effectively use classification algorithms to predict the species of Iris flowers based on feature measurements.

---

## **Future Improvements** üöÄ
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Further improve the model by optimizing hyperparameters using grid search or random search.
- **More Algorithms:** Test additional models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or XGBoost to compare performance.
- **Deployment:** Deploy the model as a web app using Flask or FastAPI to make real-time predictions.
